// Package logging owns the server's klog wiring and the runtime-reloadable
// log destination (file, stderr, or discard).
//
// The whole package exists so that runtime reloads — log_file rotations on
// SIGHUP — never call klog.SetLoggerWithOptions. klog's own contract states
// that "modifying the logger is not thread-safe and should be done while no
// other goroutines invoke log calls, usually during program initialization."
// We honor that by configuring klog exactly once in New and routing every
// subsequent reload through a mutex-guarded writer that the textlogger
// writes to.
